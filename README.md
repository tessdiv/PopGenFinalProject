# PopGenFinalProject
Population Genomics Final Project Spring 2023
This project investigates evidence of positive selection in the 3p21.31 region of chromosome 3 among five African populations. The study utilizes various tools and approaches to identify specific genomic regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be under selection. First, an FST scan is performed to identify broad regions of potential selection. Then, the RELATE software is used to narrow down the areas of interest and detect divergence between populations. Further investigation is conducted using the CLUES program, focusing on SNP 46659530, which shows potential selection criteria in certain African populations. This SNP is located in a gene enhancer region associated with transcription regulation of neighboring genes, including CCR5, a key protein involved in human adaptive immunity and HIV-1 entry into human cells. The findings suggest ongoing selection in Western African populations where HIV first emerged. The project highlights the importance of combining classical tools with more computationally intensive methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of positive selection in specific genomic regions.
